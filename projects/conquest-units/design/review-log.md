# Artist review log — Conquest units

Append-only. Artist verdicts and intent in their own words; these drive
gates and the eventual animation wave.

## 2026-09-24 — survey render sheet, artist answers (verbatim)

> barkling should be colored as a tree so wooden, and it scuttles with its
> small root like legs. the arms are swung for attacks

> petalfang is a flower serpent type, and draggs itself by its tendrils.
> the center is meant to be a snake head-esque, its facing the wrong way in
> your image

> bligghtcap also looks like its facing wrong way, and this one is a fast
> runner that stides and death is a pop

> mycothrall - yes can make more readable its meant to attach on other
> units, and it crawls

> eldroot - should be able to stand and walk with slow lumbering steps

> for now lets not animate moves yet we can come back to that

> duskmaw is a shadowy monster - also facing the wrong way, its thematic is
> meant to be its chest and bottom leg spikes form a mouth when looking at
> it

Readings:
- ANIMATION IS DEFERRED — record gaits now, author nothing until the artist
  reopens it. Gait notes: Barkling scuttles on root-legs, arms swing only
  in attacks; Petalfang drags by tendrils (not slither/cobra); Blightcap is
  a fast strider, death = quick pop (not slow bloat); Mycothrall crawls and
  ATTACHES TO OTHER UNITS (attack design implication); Eldroot stands and
  walks, slow lumbering steps (it does move).
- FACING: three units read "wrong way" on the survey sheet (petalfang,
  blightcap, duskmaw). The survey already found flower_grunt sculpted
  facing +Y against the -Y convention. A facing audit is required per unit:
  establish each sculpt's TRUE front (petalfang's front = the snake-head
  center; duskmaw's front = the view where chest + bottom leg spikes read
  as a mouth), quote current vs correct yaw, and fix in the improved copies
  + flag roster model_yaw_deg values that compensate today.
- PETALFANG's center is a SNAKE HEAD, not a blossom to enlarge — shape and
  color it to read as a head.
- MYCOTHRALL gets lurid/wet readability colors, approved.
- Duskmaw lore: shadowy monster; the chest/leg-spike mouth illusion is the
  identity — verify the game presents that view and the coloring supports it.
- Style question (faceted vs smooth) was not answered; proceeding faceted
  per docs/BLENDER_RIGGING.md and the low-poly art direction, to be
  confirmed on the next render sheet.
